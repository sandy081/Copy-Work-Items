# Copy-Work-Items
An Eclipse extension for Rational Team Concert (RTC) to copy Work Items across repositories.

## Description

This extension allows you to copy work items from one repository to another repository. This can also be used to do bulk copy across project areas in the same repository. If source and target projects are simple scrum based then this can be a tool of choice for importing.
